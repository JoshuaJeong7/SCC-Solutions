		  IntroToReferences1 r = new IntroToReferences1(); //This line is used to avoid issues
										//with calling non-static methods

		  ///As you progress in this lesson, feel free to comment out tests

		  //methodPass

		  ///--------------------FOCUS ON THIS CODE---------------------
		  
		  int x = 5;
		  r.methodPass(x); ///THIS LINE PRINTS "a = 10"

	  /**
	   * However, if you run the program right now, you'll see that x does
	   * not print 10, but still 5, meaning that x has not been changed by

	   * here?
	   */
	   
	  /**
	   * The answer is a concept called PASS BY VALUE. In Java, when any
	   * variable is passed into a method as a parameter, the computer
	   * copies the value of the variable and stores it in a completely new
	   * varaible. In other words, the variable passed as a parameter and
	   * the variable in the main function are two completely separate
	   * variables.
	   * For simplicity, this can be represented by the following:
	   * +——————————————+				 ___________	  
	   * |	methodPass	|				/ house 3bC \    
	   * +——————————————+				+———————————+    
	   * |	a	(3bc)	|               |  a = 5  <------+
	   * +——————————————+               +———————————+	 |
	   * 												 |
	   * +——————————————+				 ___________	 |
	   * |  main        |			    / house f59 \	 |
	   * +——————————————+				+———————————+	 |
	   * |  x   (f59)   |				|  x = 5  -------+    
	   * +——————————————+				+———————————+
	   * 
	   * x and a live in completely different "houses". Therefore, they
	   * are completely different variables themselves, so do not treat them
	   * like they are the same variable! Instead, a is a different variable
	   * that happens to have the same value as x does, but is still different
	   * from x regardless.
	   * So in methodPass(), when a is incremented by 5, the diagram looks like this:
	   * 
	   * +——————————————+				 ___________	  
	   * |	methodPass	|				/ house 3bC \    
	   * +——————————————+				+———————————+    
	   * |		a + 5	|               |  a = 10   | 
	   * +——————————————+               +———————————+	 
	   * 												 
	   * +——————————————+				 ___________	 
	   * |  main        |			    / house f59 \	 
	   * +——————————————+				+———————————+	 
	   * |     x        |				|  x = 5    |
	   * +——————————————+				+———————————+
	   * 
	   * Notice that a has been incremented, but not x. This is because a
	   * is treated as a completely unrelated to x, so when one variable is
	   * incremented, it holds no change on the other variable.
	   * Pass by value applies to any primitive data type, including Strings.
	   */
	   
	   /*
	    * Want some practice with pass by value? Here are some more methods
	    * that will make changes in operations. Your job is to trace what the
	    * values of each variable and determine what is printed in
	    * passByValueTests().
