	     * 
	     * In reality, these names of "class1" and "class2" are arbitrary;
	     * the real representation of these objects are the memory addresses associated
	     * with them: 133312 for "class1" and 886644 for "class2".
	     * 
	     * When an object from classPassTester is passed into classSwap,
	     * what's really passed between methods is the memory address,
	     * such as 133312. Since the memory address is the same across
	     * both methods, they refer to the exact same object. In classSwap,
	     * this object is called "classy", while in classPassTester, the object
	     * is called "class1". This means that changing the object in 
	     * classSwap WILL change the object in classPassTester, 
	     * because they share the same object.
