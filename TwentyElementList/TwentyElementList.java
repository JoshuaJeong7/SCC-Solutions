    //The following is one possible way to compactly add several elements into a linked list.
    //You must define the root as having the first value, then create a tempRoot auxillary variable.

    //on the auxillary variable, then moving the variable itself into the .next pointer.

    //NOTE: You may be wondering why we need a tempRoot variable in the first place, and why we shouldn't
    //do the exact same loop with the root variable. The answer is, if we change the root variable to
    //be equal to its pointer, then what points back to the first element? Nothing will, so we have effectively
    //lost access to the entire list. We need to maintain at least one variable's reference to the first element,
    //so that we retain access to the list.
    
    //NOTE 2: Yes, changing the .root variable on tempRoot will reflect those same changes to the original root,
    //because of Pass By Reference!
